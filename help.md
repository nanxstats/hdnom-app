# Welcome to the hdnom web app

The _hdnom_ web application helps you build penalized Cox models for high-dimensional data with survival outcomes. All 9 types of model included in the _hdnom_ package are supported. It streamlined the process of nomogram building, model validation, model calibration, and reproducible report generation --- all done inside your web browser.

A common and logical usage of the web app would be: click **Upload** to upload your dataset; specify the parameters for building models in the **Nomogram** panel; then validate/calibrate the built model in the **Validation**/**Calibration** panels. Finally, you will be able to download the PDF/HTML/Word report containing all the results in the **Report** panel. Once the computation and plotting is finished in one panel, simply click and switch to the next panel to continue.
