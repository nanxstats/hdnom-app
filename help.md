# Welcome to the hdnom web app

The _hdnom_ web application helps you build penalized Cox models for high-dimensional data with survival outcomes. All the 9 types of model included in the _hdnom_ package are supported. It streamlined the process of nomogram building, model validation, model calibration, and reproducible report generation --- all done inside your web browser.

A common and logical usage of the web app:

 1. Click **Upload** to upload your dataset;
 2. Specify the parameters for building models in the **Nomogram** tab;
 3. Validate/calibrate the built model in the **Validation**/**Calibration** tabs;
 4. Finally, you will be able to download the PDF/HTML/Word report containing all the results in the **Report** tab.

Once the computation and plotting is finished in one tab, simply click and switch to the next tab to continue.
