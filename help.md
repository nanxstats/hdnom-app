# Welcome to the hdnom web app

The hdnom web application helps you build penalized Cox models for high-dimensional data with survival outcomes. All 9 types of model included in the hdnom package are supported. It can help you build nomograms, validate the model, calibrate the model, and generate reproducible PDF/HTML/Word reports, all in a browser.

Click `Upload` to start uploading your dataset. Once the computation and plotting is finished in one panel, simply switch to the next panel to continue.
